# C++ Training Repo

This repo is for storage of topics, trainings, and materials used while I learn C++.


# Notes

## How Computers Work

- CPU
    - ALU (Arithmetic logic unit)
    - CU (Control Unit)
- Main Memory
- Input
    - Buffer
- Output
    - Buffer
- Files (HDD)

## Introduction to Number Systems

- Hex 16 decimal

## Programming Paradigm

- Monolithic
    The entire program code source code is a single file
- Modular
    - Able call same code multiple times
     - Team can work on each function and share the load
- Object Oriented

## What is an Algorithm

- Algorithm
    Machine instruction for solving a problem
    Procedures
    Centuries old
- Psuedocode
- Program
    Machine instruction for solving a problem

Algorithm --> Program
Psuedocode not standardized, leads into algorithm

## What is a FlowChart

Designed during monolithic programming

Before you write program, write flow chart to understand the program.

Three components of FlowChart:

- Input
- Process
- Output

### FlowChart for adding two numbers

`(Start) --> [Print "Enter 2 Numbers; Read a,b] --> |c <-- a+b| --> [print "sum is ", c] --> (Stop)`

### FlowChart for finxing greater number

`(Start) --> [Print "Enter 2 Numbers; Read a,b] --> <If a > b> --> ^True --> |Print a| ^False --> |Print b| --> (Stop)`

## Stops for Program Development and Execution

1. Editing
2. Compiling
3. Linking Library
4. Loading
5. Execution

IDE

- Turbo C++
- Devcpp
- Xcode
- CodeBlocks
- Eclipse
- Visual Studio
