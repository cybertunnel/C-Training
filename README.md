# C++ Training Repo

This repo is for storage of topics, trainings, and materials used while I learn C++.


# Notes

## How Computers Work

- CPU
    - ALU (Arithmetic logic unit)
    - CU (Control Unit)
- Main Memory
- Input
    - Buffer
- Output
    - Buffer
- Files (HDD)

## Introduction to Number Systems

- Hex 16 decimal

## Programming Paradigm

- Monolithic
    The entire program code source code is a single file
- Modular
    - Able call same code multiple times
     - Team can work on each function and share the load
- Object Oriented

## What is an Algorithm

- Algorithm
    Machine instruction for solving a problem
    Procedures
    Centuries old
- Psuedocode
- Program
    Machine instruction for solving a problem

Algorithm --> Program
Psuedocode not standardized, leads into algorithm

## What is a FlowChart

Designed during monolithic programming
